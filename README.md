# 📊 US Companies Revenue Analysis with Power BI & Python

This project demonstrates a full data analysis pipeline that combines **Python** for web data extraction and **Power BI** for interactive dashboard creation and business intelligence using **DAX measures**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

We analyzed a dataset of top US companies by revenue, extracted from Wikipedia, and built a data model in Power BI to gain insights such as:
- Revenue distribution across industries
- Employee count and company size
- Revenue per employee
- Top 10 companies by total revenue
- Growth rate analysis

The project is ideal for practicing **data wrangling**, **DAX calculations**, and **interactive visual storytelling**.
